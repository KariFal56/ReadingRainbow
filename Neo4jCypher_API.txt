//For API
[HttpPut]
Due to the nature of Neo4j (and other graphical databases), creating new Users and or New Books consists of creating a new Node. However, it is possible that such book node already exists so it 
may be better to use Put (or use MERGE in Cypher code which Creates Unique book nodes).

Create New User
Get, Set Unique_User_Name
Get, Set Profile_Info
Get, Set Portrait_URL

CREATE (p:Person{name:"Unique_User_Name" , profile:"Profile_Info" , portrait:"Portrait_URL"})
RETURN p

//Create New Book (safer to use Merge in case Book already in Neo4j)
MERGE (b:Book { id: Book_ID, title: B_Title, author: B_Authors, thumbnail: B_Thumbnail, publishdate: B_Publish_Date, pagenum: B_Pages, description: B_Description, isbn10: B_ISBN_10, isbn13: B_ISBN_13 })

//Add Book to Library (create IN_LIBRARY)
Get, Set Unique_User_Name,
Get, Set Google_Book_ID

MATCH (p:Person), (b:Book) 
WHERE p.name="Unique_User_Name" AND b.id="Google_Book_ID"
CREATE (p)-[r:IN_LIBRARY]->(b)
RETURN p,b

//Add Book to WishList (create WISH_LISTS relation)
Get, Set Unique_User_Name,
Get, Set Google_Book_ID

MATCH (p:Person), (b:Book)

CREATE (p)-[r:WISH_LISTS]->(b)

Get, Set Unique_User_Name,
