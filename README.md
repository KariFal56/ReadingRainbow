ui-screen+navigation Log: 10/11/2020

17 classes created to render screens. Rudimentary navigation between screens are functional but not the most user friendly (due mostly to inability to present friend list names from flatlist).

Current Issues that need resolving:
Drawer functionality is not working. Drawer navigation, icons, buttons, and the such are implemented by not functional. Suspect the drawer navigation/class must be moved to seperate file and exported to work.
Friendlist features are not functional due to changes in functional hooks. Flatlist no longer can take useState functions and must be revised. 
Preferences Page: class and code is written but not implemented at this time.
